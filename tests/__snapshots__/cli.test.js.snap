Usage: govuk-frontend-diff http://localhost:3000 --govuk-frontend-version=v3.7.0
--exclude=page-template

Commands:
  govuk-frontend-diff <url>  URL to a server which will render your templates
                             for each component/template/params combination.

                             The html output from this will then be compared
                             against the reference Nunjucks templates.

                             This server must:

                             - Have /component/<component-name> and /template
                             routes which accept data POSTed as JSON
                             - Respond with rendered html

                             A reference server and more detailed instructions
                             can be found in the readme at
                             https://github.com/surevine/govuk-frontend-diff


Options:
  --help                    Show help                                  [boolean]
  --version                 Show version number                        [boolean]
  --govuk-frontend-version  Version of govuk-frontend to test against.
                            This will normally be references to tags like v3.7.0
                            but this will accept any commit-ish such as branches
                            or even commit identifiers.
                            If not specified, the most recent govuk-frontend tag
                            will be used.
  --force-refresh           Force a re-download of govuk-frontend, bypassing the
                            cache. Useful if the version you are specifying
                            represents a branch such as if you were testing
                            against master                             [boolean]
  --include                 Specify a subset of the tests to run. Should be one
                            or more names of components, space separated

                            For example --include accordion button       [array]
  --exclude                 Specify a subset of the tests to exclude. Should be
                            one or more names of components, space separated
                                                                         [array]
  --verbose, --ci           Verbose logging instead of a simple progress bar.
                            More suitable for CI situations where the progress
                            bar is not useful.                         [boolean]
  --hide-diffs              Hide the html diffs from output            [boolean]
  --ignore-attributes       Attributes to exclude from html diffing      [array]
