Usage: govuk-frontend-diff ./render.sh --govuk-frontend-version=v3.7.0
--exclude=page-template

Commands:
  govuk-frontend-diff <script>  Path to a script which will render your
                                templates for each component/template/params
                                combination.

                                The html output from this script will then be
                                compared against the reference Nunjucks
                                templates.

                                This script must:

                                take --component and --params arguments (For
                                rendering individual components)

                                take --template and --params arguments (For
                                rendering the base template)

                                return the rendered html for a given
                                template/component/params combo on stdout

Options:
  --help                    Show help                                  [boolean]
  --version                 Show version number                        [boolean]
  --govuk-frontend-version  Version of govuk-frontend to test against.
                            This will normally be references to tags like v3.7.0
                            but this will accept any commit-ish such as branches
                            or even commit identifiers.
                            If not specified, the most recent govuk-frontend tag
                            will be used.
  --force-refresh           Force a re-download of govuk-frontend, bypassing the
                            cache. Useful if the version you are specifying
                            represents a branch such as if you were testing
                            against master                             [boolean]
  --include                 Specify a subset of the tests to run. Should
                            be one or more names of components, space
                            separated

                            For example --include accordion button

  --exclude                 Specify a subset of the tests to exclude. Should be
                            one or more names of components, space separated
                                                                         [array]
  --verbose, --ci           Verbose logging instead of a simple progress bar.
                            More suitable for CI situations where the progress
                            bar is not useful.                         [boolean]
  --hide-diffs              Hide the html diffs from output            [boolean]
